#### We're building **_MREX - A DECENTRALIZED VAULT OF MEDICAL RECORDS._**

## OUR AIM

Our aim is to revolutionalize the way medical records are stored and shared between doctors and clients by decentralizing the process.

## HOW WE KEEP THE DATA SECURE

Every file that is uploaded by the client will be *encrypted* and will be uploaded on **_IPFS_**. The Client will not have to trust any central authority with their sensitive medical records but they will be able to access them using their credentials

## SHARING REPORTS

Clients will also have the option to share reports with doctors who will get access to the clients key for that report, and they will be able to download the report

### **_Our team members include:_**

    1. Aryamann Ningombam
    2. Dhruva Goyal
    3. Aditya Mohan
    4. Sitaraman S
