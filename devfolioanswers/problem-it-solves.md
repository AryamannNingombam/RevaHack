### The Problem

Understandably so, any user would be skeptical of trusting an unknown organization with their medical records. Medical records hold highly sensitive information about the health of a person. In the wrong hands, the situation can be lead to making the user subject to exploitation. **MRex** addresses that by creating a ***highly secure and decentralized system*** to store medical reports that can only be ***accessed by the intended users***. 

### Why MRex

Essentially, think of MRex and our use of [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/) as a place where the medical records are stored, the links to which are ***publicly accessible***. ***However, there's a catch!*** There is virtually no way to access these records in an intelligible format. Our platform ***encrypts all the reports and uploads on IPFS***. Only the report's owner can get it decrypted on our application. As an additional feature, they can ***grant access to any trusted user*** by entering their email. 




### How We're Different

Government websites are seldom the most reliable. This could look like anything from server errors where users would have to wait an extended period of time to get access to time-sensitive information, or loss of information during transfer. Despite this, only about ***1 in 5 people*** actually notice these errors. When in the context of something as crucial as health information, this is far from ideal. We at MRex make sure that these technical errors never are an issue, and the user has a ***seamless experience*** when using our product.

### Indian Adoption

The adoption of Electronic Medical Reports (EMR) is very tragic in India in comparison to the rest of the world. MRex offers an ***effortless experience***, while ***boosting EMR adoption rates***. 


### Conclusion

All in all, our features, reliability, and ease of use makes MRex **THE platform** for users to streamline their confidential medical information in a ***decentralized system***.
